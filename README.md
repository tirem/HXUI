***INSTALLATION***
* Download the latest release of XIUI by [visiting our release page](https://github.com/tirem/XIUI/releases).
* Extract the downloaded **XIUI-release.zip** file.
* Once extracted, you will have a directory called XIUI-release.  Open up this directory, and inside of it will be a directory called XIUI.
* Copy the XIUI directory to your Ashita addons folder, located at `..\addons`.
* To manually load XIUI, type `/addon load XIUI` in the Final Fantasy XI client.
* To configure XIUI, type `/xiui`.

***FOR HORIZON XI***
* It is recommended that you follow these steps to load XIUI by default:
    * Open up the file `default.txt` in the `HorizonXI\Game\scripts` folder.
    * Navigate to the section titled "Plugin and Addon Configurations"
    * After the `/wait 3` line, and below the block of `=======`, add the following line:
        * `/addon load xiui`
    * Save this file.  XIUI should automatically load when you start Final Fantasy XI.

***UPGRADING FROM HXUI***

This addon was recently renamed from HXUI to XIUI. Your settings will be automatically migrated on first load.

1. Download the latest XIUI release
2. Delete your old `HXUI` folder from your addons directory
3. Extract the new `XIUI` folder into your addons directory
4. Load the addon with `/addon load xiui`

You'll see a message in chat confirming the migration: `[XIUI] Successfully migrated settings from HXUI.`

***UPDATING NOTES***

It is recommended to delete the `XIUI` folder in your addons directory before upgrading to a new version, as asset directories may change during development.
